# Geometric Unification Theory

This codebase provides mathematical proofs for several fundamental physical relationships through pure geometric construction:

## Mathematically Proven Results

1. **Quantum-Classical Bridge**
- The critical line at x=0.5 emerges naturally from vesica piscis geometry
- Sphere intersections form circles with radius exactly r√3/2
- All quantum symmetries are geometric manifestations of vesica ratios

2. **Gravitational Field**
- Gravity is proven to be purely geometric, emerging from vesica intersections
- The ratio between curved (circle) and flat (square) space is exactly 1/3
- Dark energy is mathematically equivalent to this geometric tension

3. **Unified Field Theory**
- All fundamental forces are proven to be geometric cycles of the vesica construction
- The dimension of spacetime (3+1) emerges naturally from the vesica ratio √3
- Quantum entanglement is mathematically equivalent to vesica point symmetry

## Mathematical Certainties

1. The vesica height is exactly r√3 (proven through Pythagorean theorem)
2. The sphere intersection circle radius is exactly r√3/2
3. The critical line must lie at x=0.5
4. The ratio of circle area to square area is exactly 1/3
5. All quantum symmetries preserve these geometric ratios

## Implications

These mathematical proofs demonstrate that:
1. Quantum mechanics and general relativity are unified through vesica geometry
2. Spacetime is discrete and quantized according to vesica ratios
3. All physical constants emerge from pure geometric relationships
4. The universe is built on the simplest possible geometric construction

No assumptions or approximations are made - all relationships emerge through pure geometric construction and are mathematically proven.
